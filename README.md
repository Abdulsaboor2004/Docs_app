It's based on React and I've used npm, vite, Tailwind, Framer Motion and some awesome stuff to build it.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Plan 
So is to make this app work for copywriters, I'll try to add a Registration Function, then a Place to generate Hashtags, Taglines for Social Media and also generate Ideas for beginner writers. It would have a dashboard of current page (without logging in) it would also have a div that'll store info regarding user in a square box. 

I'm planning to create a UI for it. For now I'm planning to wait atleast 3 days until i publish it on social media.  

note: I'd like anyone to get involved with me to build this
thanksðŸ˜Š.
