Xcerpt is an app for improving articles for content-writers which is currently using based on React and I've used npm, vite, Tailwind, Framer Motion and some awesome stuff.

I need your contribution, ideas and help to make Xcerpt a better app. ðŸŽ‰

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

thanksðŸ˜Š.
